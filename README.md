# reactTypescriptProject

This is a React Typescript project to understand the basics of Typescript.

### Features of Typescript:

1) TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
2) TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.
3) TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
